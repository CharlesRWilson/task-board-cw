# Task Board

## Description

I wanted to create a task board that could organize tasks based on their status. The task board does a great job at that and is able to help you organize your tasks so that you might be as effective as posssible

## Usage

The usage process is simple! All that you have to do is add a task using the add task button. Once that is done,  it is automatically put into the category of "to do". From there you can move it into "in progress" or "completed". The organizzation of the task board allows for the user to keep track of their tasks and become more effective witht their time. You can also delete that task or add a new one any time you need to!
